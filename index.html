	 <h2>Introduction</h2>
	 <p>Throughout my past one-and-a-half years in the Stuyvesant
		 <a href = "https://www.speechanddebate.org/competition-events/"> Lincoln-Douglas debate </a>
		 team, I've had the privilege of learning quite a bit about various moral theories, which can be referred to as "normative ethics". Though there's still a lot for me to learn, I wanted to share some of my knowledge, because it's something I'm really interested in. I hope you enjoy!
	 </p>
	 
	 <h2>Consequentialism</h2>
	 <p>
		 Essentially, consequentialism boils down to what the impacts of one's actions were. <a href = "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/">This</a> is the moral theory that is the most easy to understand, as most people find it their inherent way of thinking. When explaining consequentialism, people generally give the example of hedonistic utilitarianism, often referred to as just "util." Hedonistic utilitarianism can be simplified to taking actions that "maximize pleasure and minimize pain for the greatest amount of people". However, utilitarianism isn't the only consequentialist ethical theory, of course. Any moral theory that looks at an action's consequences to evaluate morality will fall under this category.
	 </p>
	 
	 <h2>Deontology</h2>
	 <p>
		 Deontology is a type of intent-based ethics. Conceptually, <a href = "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/">it</a> doesn't seem too difficult to understand. It evaluates how moral the "causes" of an action are, much like how consequentialism looks at the "effects". The most common deontological theory is known as Kantianism, as it is based on the ideas of a philosopher named Immanuel Kant. Kant believes that every person must follow a set of universalizable maxims. In other words, each person must follow the same set of rules. This means that "every person must murder everyone else" cannot be a universalizable maxim, since if every person was murdered, there would be no one to do the murdering. Therefore, that is why murdering is unethical. Ultimately, this means that you must respect every rational agent's capabilities of practical reason, as well as their right to personal freedoms. 
	 </p>
	 
	 <h2>Virtue Ethics</h2>
	 <p>
		 The third section of normative ethics is the one I know least about: 
		 <a href = "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/">virtue ethics</a>
		 . This type of ethics is rarely used in Lincoln-Douglas debate; in fact, many of my mentors have deliberately glossed over it, stating that it's "unimportant." Rather than looking at the morality of an action, it looks at the morality of the agent that performed this action. 
	 </p>
	 
	 <h2>The Trolley Problem</h2>
	 <img src = "TheTrolleyProblem.png">
	 <p>
		 The easiest way to understand the difference between these three ethical theories is which the famous moral dilemma known as The Trolley Problem. Keep in mind that it is a bit morbid.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 	<b>The Premise:</b> There is a trolley heading down a track. If it continues down this path, it will hit and kill five people that are tied up on the track. However, you have the option of pulling a lever. This means that the trolley will switch to a second track, and thus only hit and kill one person instead. For the sake of the problem, assume that there is no way for you to stop the trolley, and no way for the six individuals to escape. Now, how would each ethical theory evaluate this situation?
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <b>Consequentialism:</b> According to consequentialism, you should pull the lever. To many, this is probably the most obvious solution. After all, it's better that one person dies rather than five, right? In this situation, you're evaluating the consequences of your decision by choosing to save five people's lives at the cost of one person's life. 
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <b>Deontology:</b> However, deontology would disagree with that decision. According to intent-based ethics, choosing to pull that lever would be the same as choosing to kill one person. When you pull that lever, you <i>know</i> that a person is going to die specifically because of your actions. It's better to not get involved in the situation at all. If the trolley runs over five people, it's not your fault, as you played no role in that situation. 
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <b>Virtue Ethics:</b> Virtue ethics get a bit more complicated when evaluating the decision. As mentioned earlier, virtue ethics are about evaluating a person's moral character rather than the intentions or consequences of their actions. Therefore, it essentially boils down to <i>why</i> a person chose to make that decision. For example, let's say that a person chose to pull the lever, thus saving the five people while the one person dies. However, the reason they do so is because that one person was their ex-partner, not because they wanted to save five people. In this situation, even though they saved five people, they did it for a selfish reason. Therefore, this would not be an ethical decision.
